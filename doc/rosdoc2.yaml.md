# Using a `rosdoc2.yaml` file to control how your package is documented

Package authors can specify a rosdoc2.yaml file that provides customization of many of the features of **rosdoc2**. To specify this file, you need to:
- Modify the `export` section of your `package.xml` file to point to a `rosdoc2.yaml` configuration file. For example, the `export` section should look like this:
```xml
...
  <export>
    ...
    <rosdoc2>rosdoc2.yaml</rosdoc2>
  </export>
```
- include and customize the `rosdoc2.yaml` file.

The ```default_config``` command will generate a template for a configuration file `rosdoc2.yaml` that is can be customize **rosdoc2** operation. Run **rosdoc2** as follows:

```
usage: rosdoc2 default_config [-h] --package-path PACKAGE_PATH

Create a default rosdoc2 config file in a package

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --package-path PACKAGE_PATH, -p PACKAGE_PATH
                        path to the ROS package
To generate a default config file, run

```

That operation will generate a file rosdoc2.yaml in your package directory. Here is the result of that (though you might want to run that yourself to get a current version). Note there are no required options to be set in this file, so uncomment only those you want to change. The defaults should be valid though:

```yaml
## Default configuration, generated by rosdoc2.

## This 'attic section' self-documents this file's type and version.
type: 'rosdoc2 config'
version: 1

settings: {
    ## This setting is relevant mostly if the standard Python package layout cannot
    ## be assumed for 'sphinx-apidoc' invocation. The user can provide the path
    ## (relative to the 'package.xml' file) where the Python modules defined by this
    ## package are located.
    # python_source: 'YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME',

    ## This setting, if true, attempts to run `doxygen` and the `breathe`/`exhale`
    ## extensions to `sphinx` regardless of build type. This is most useful if the
    ## user would like to generate C/C++ API documentation for a package that is not
    ## of the `ament_cmake/cmake` build type.
    # always_run_doxygen: false,

    ## This setting, if true, will skip running doxygen` and the `breathe`/`exhale`
    ## extensions to `sphinx` regardless of build type. This is most useful if the
    ## user has generated C++ documentation elsewhere that is included in the doc
    ## folder, or in external documentation.
    # never_run_doxygen: false,

    ## This setting, if true, attempts to run `sphinx-apidoc` regardless of build
    ## type. This is most useful if the user would like to generate Python API
    ## documentation for a package that is not of the `ament_python` build type.
    # always_run_sphinx_apidoc: false,

    ## This setting, if true, will skip running `sphinx-apidoc` regardless of build

    ## that is included in the doc folder, or in external documentation.
    # never_run_sphinx_apidoc: false,

    ## This setting, if provided, will override the build_type of this package
    ## for documentation purposes only. If not provided, documentation will be
    ## generated assuming the build_type in package.xml.
    # override_build_type: 'catkin',

    ## This setting, if true, will skip using breathe to process the C++ documentation, and
    #  use the doxygen html instead. This is intended for cases where breathe is throwing
    #  errors.

builders:
    ## Each stanza represents a separate build step, performed by a specific 'builder'.
    ## The key of each stanza is the builder to use; this must be one of the
    ## available builders.
    ## The value of each stanza is a dictionary of settings for the builder that
    ## outputs to that directory.
    ## Keys in all settings dictionary are:
    ##  * 'output_dir' - determines output subdirectory for builder instance
    ##                   relative to --output-directory
    ##  * 'name' - used when referencing the built docs from the index.

    - doxygen: {
        # name: 'minimum_package Public C/C++ API',
        # output_dir: 'generated/doxygen',
        ## file name for a user-supplied Doxyfile
        # doxyfile: null,
        ## additional statements to add to the Doxyfile, list of strings
        # extra_doxyfile_statements: [],

        # output_dir: '',
        ## If sphinx_sourcedir is specified and not null, then the documentation in that folder
        ## (specified relative to the package.xml directory) will replace rosdoc2's normal output.
        ## If sphinx_sourcedir is left unspecified, any documentation found in the doc/ or
        ## doc/source/ folder will still be included by default, along with other relevant package
        ## information.
        # sphinx_sourcedir: null,
        ## Directory (relative to the package.xml directory) where user documentation is found. If
        ## documentation is in one of the standard locations (doc/ or doc/source) this is not
        ## needed. Unlike sphinx_sourcedir, specifying this does not override the standard rosdoc2
        ## output, but includes this user documentation along with other items included by default
        ## by rosdoc2.
